# least-squares-fitting-routine :chart_with_upwards_trend:

This is a least squares fitting routine I wrote for laboratory work whilst at university :mortar_board:.

I worte this before I'd learnt a lot of the best practices such as TDD so its not the best code in the world!
I'm keeping it around because I'd like to revisit it some day and tidy things up.
